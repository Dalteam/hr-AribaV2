## Plan for Porting the React System to Our System (ARIBA HR)

> Written 2026-10-18 on branch `feature/hr-react-port` (from `main` at `494998d`).
> Reference: `~/Desktop/HR/مقارنة_المعادلات.xlsx` (188 rows), the HR department's code in `~/Desktop/مشروع الموارد البشرية/React` (read-only), `ARIBA_MASTER_CONTEXT.md`.
> Rule: our system is the foundation (FastAPI + Next.js 16 + Expo + the organized Railway schema). We port their features, formulas and screens, not their technical approach: no browser-to-database connection, no final calculations in the browser, and no PWA.

### 0. Legend
- Rows: 🟢 stays · 🟠/🔴 modified to match their formula · 🟣 removed · 🔵 added.
- Functions: ✅ exists on our side · ✏️ exists and gets modified · 🆕 new · ✖ not ported (replaced by our approach).
- All paths are under `/api/v1`.

### 1. Approved decisions (from the prompt, not to be revisited)
1. Rows 113 and 142 are not removed: they are modified to match their app screen (`Home.jsx`: "Year-end balance" and "Remote remaining" = `remote_days_per_year − remoteDaysUsed`, default 10) and the company card "Remote work limit".
2. Row 66: automatic termination at contract end is removed. Their behavior is ported: saving a terminated employee whose fixed-term contract has not ended ← returns them to active, plus a "Reactivate" button in the list.
3. What they store in the browser moves to the server (`ariba_app_settings`): master lists, report templates, the salary certificate outgoing-number counter, ID issue place. The employee's signature stays on their device only (`expo-secure-store` / browser), and the server receives the document after the signature is merged.
4. Leave balance in the app and the manager's team is computed by the server with the same engine and the selected method (`leave_accrual_method`). No snapshots.
5. Mail passwords are encrypted (AES-GCM, key `MAIL_SECRET_KEY` in environment variables).
6. Email: SMTP, Resend and Microsoft Graph, with PDF attachments.
7. Calculations happen on the server, or in `lib/calc` on the website for instant display. The final reference is the server's result, using their same formula.
8. Unpaid leave deduction and salary advance in the payroll are manual, like theirs.
9. Their defects are not ported: the audit log from the browser, the bell every 3 seconds, `sw.js`, settings hard-coded in the code.

### 2. New structure in our server
| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/routers/canonical.py` | Stays (current routes) with the modifications |
| `backend/app/routers/port_workflow.py` | New request workflow: new types, return, rejection with reason, escalation, deadline settings, delegation, manager permissions, submitting on behalf, team requests |
| `backend/app/routers/port_candidates.py` | Candidates and links + the public routes `/public/apply*` |
| `backend/app/routers/port_goals.py` | Targets and evaluation |
| `backend/app/routers/port_docs.py` | Document signing, leave attachments |
| `backend/app/routers/port_mail.py` | Mail accounts, sending a document/report, messages |
| `backend/app/routers/port_tasks.py` | Team availability, tasks and meetings |
| `backend/app/routers/port_assets.py` | Assets and custody |
| `backend/app/routers/port_audit.py` | Audit log and month-deletion requests |
| `backend/app/routers/port_settings.py` | New settings (kv, permissions, roles, Ramadan, branding, country…) + `/public/brand` + password recovery + color extraction |
| `backend/app/routers/port_ai.py` | The assistant: command parsing on the server + execution after confirmation |
| `backend/app/services/port_*.py` | Logic: workflow2, mailer, crypto, scheduler, schedule (working hours/Ramadan), country (Egypt), audit, tasks |
| `backend/app/services/scheduler.py` | Scheduled jobs inside the server (asyncio): escalation every hour, email flush every 5 minutes, automatic candidate registration every minute |

### 3. New tables and settings (Task 5)
| Table | Keys and relations | Their counterpart |
|---|---|---|
| `ariba_candidates` | PK id uuid · `employee_id` FK → employee_directory (SET NULL) | Same |
| `ariba_candidate_files` | PK · `candidate_id` FK → ariba_candidates (CASCADE) | Same |
| `ariba_candidate_invites` | PK token · `candidate_id` FK (SET NULL) | Same |
| `ariba_targets` | PK · `employee_id` FK → employee_directory | Same |
| `ariba_evaluations` | PK · UNIQUE(employee_id, period_type, period_key) · FK | Same |
| `ariba_delegations` | PK employee_id FK · `manager_id` FK | Same |
| `ariba_manager_perms` | PK manager_id FK | Same |
| `ariba_doc_signing` | PK request_id · `document_id` FK → ariba_documents (CASCADE) · employee/manager FK | Same |
| `ariba_leave_files` | PK · `employee_id` FK · `leave_id` text (request number) | Same |
| `ariba_mail_accounts` | PK owner (`company` or employee number) · `password_enc` bytea instead of text | Same + encryption |
| `ariba_tasks` | PK · `created_by` FK · kind task/meeting · title, notes, due_at, starts_at, ends_at, location, status | New (the file `5_run_in_SQL_Editor_team_tasks_and_fixes.sql` was not delivered) |
| `ariba_task_assignees` | PK(task_id, employee_id) · FKs · status pending/accepted/declined/done · reason | New |
| `ariba_audit_purge_requests` | Exists on our side | Exists |
| `ariba_assets`, `ariba_asset_custody_log` | Both exist on our side | Exists |
| `ariba_webauthn_credentials` | PK · account_id FK → ariba_auth_accounts · credential_id, public_key, sign_count | New (fingerprint login on the website) |
| `ariba_push_tokens` | PK token · account_id FK | New (Push for the app) |
| `workflow_notifications` | + `emailed_at`, `email_error`, `email_tries` | Same |

**Settings (`ariba_app_settings`):** `workflow_config`, `doc_sign_cfg`, `leave_accrual_method`, `leave_carry`, `attendance_schedule`, `country_system`, `brand_colors`, `punch_watermark`, `letterhead`, `hr_signer`, `candidate_auto`, `apply_public_url`, `master_lists`, `report_templates`, `salary_cert_seq`, `id_issue_place`, `ins_settings`, `perms_matrix`. **(`ariba_security_flags`):** `apply_form_key`, `apply_invite_only`, `apply_invite_hours`. **(`company_settings`/attendance):** `ramadan_flex_enabled`, `ramadan_window_start/end`, `ramadan_shift_hours`, `ramadan_from/to`, `remote_days_per_year`.

### 4. Removal list 🟣 (Task 4)
| Row | Item | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 66 | Automatic termination at contract end | Removed — **and added**: reactivation on save + a "Reactivate" button (decision 2) |
| 70, 82 | Art. 87 (correction D) | Removed from the page, the settlement and the payroll |
| 72 | Art. 77 for fixed-term contracts (correction C) | Removed — treated like open-ended |
| 100 | 2024 carry-forward rule | Removed |
| 113 | Year-end balance in the app | **Not removed** — modified (decision 1) |
| 114 | Freezing a terminated employee's balance | Removed |
| 137 | Clearing the previous session's check-out (K) | Removed |
| 142 | Remote work counter | **Not removed** — modified (decision 1) |
| 153 | Labor law notice on requests (E/F) | Removed |
| 188 | Login lockout after failed attempts | Removed |
| — | Corrections A, B, G, J, K, I (removed within their 🔴 rows by matching their formula) | 20/69/81, 74, 25–27, 12, 136, holidays notice I |

### 5. The six gaps (built from their screens' behavior)
1. `ariba_team_availability` → `GET /team/availability`: merging consecutive leaves, "upcoming leave" within 14 days, "returns to work" = first working day after the leave.
2. `ariba_my_tasks` / `ariba_send_task` / `ariba_task_update` → `/tasks`: task or meeting, a warning if an invitee is on leave, done/accept/decline with reason/cancel.
3. `ariba_hr_set_ramadan_flex` → `PUT /settings/attendance/ramadan`, read by `GET /settings/attendance` (+ `is_ramadan_today`).
4. `ariba_get_brand` → `GET /public/brand` (company colors + punch logo).
5. `ariba-password-recovery` → `POST /auth/password-recovery` (username or iqama number, temporary password to the registered email).
6. `ariba-brand-colors` → `POST /settings/brand/extract` (colors from the company website URL).

### 6. Additions from the report and the code (🔵 outside the comparison file)
- Ariba AI assistant (understands colloquial Arabic, opens pages, statistics, attendance, leave, message, password reset, form/settlement/payslip, confirmation before execution) → `services/port_ai.py` (porting `aiParse.js` to Python) + `components/hr/ai-assistant.tsx`.
- Fingerprint / Face ID: the app uses `expo-local-authentication` + "Remember me" and "Forget this device"; the website uses WebAuthn (`ariba_webauthn_credentials`).
- Deleting a month older than 30 days from the audit log via a request to Finance (approve/reject).
- Importing employees from Excel/CSV with column mapping, preview, template, and updating existing ones (V139).
- Arabic/English with direction, dark mode, Ariba colors as variables (partially exists, to be completed).
- Notification bell with a counter: the website refreshes every 20 seconds; the app uses Push + refresh on open.
- Fallback when sending fails: download PDF + open Outlook (desktop `mailto:` or web), a per-device setting.
- Settings in 9 numbered sections with search, 24 cards.
- 10 Arabic/English documents (`<!--ARIBA_EN-->`), job offer, outgoing number `AR-YYYYMMDD-n` + Hijri, bulk sending, single-page A4 PDF (scaling down to 1.35).
- Automatic candidate registration (`candidate_auto`) as a scheduled job.
- Payroll path: HR preparation ← Finance approval ← reopening with a reason ≥ 5 characters, autosave, syncing others' edits.
- Assets and custody: straight-line depreciation, default useful lives, non-capital, annual inventory, custody tab in the employee file.
- Allowance as a percentage (`allowModes`), dependents with their attachments, "Restore" for each field.
- Custom report builder + templates saved on the server + "Export page" (Excel/PDF/Word/email).
- Yearly balances editor (yearEnd/current/carryNext/eos manual) + log of the last 10 saves + "Undo last save".

### 7. Phases (each phase is a commit and tested on its own)

## خطة نقل نظام React إلى نظامنا (ARIBA HR)

> كُتب 2026-10-18 على الفرع `feature/hr-react-port` (من `main` عند `494998d`).
> المرجع: `~/Desktop/HR/مقارنة_المعادلات.xlsx` (188 صفاً)، كود قسم الموارد في `~/Desktop/مشروع الموارد البشرية/React` (للقراءة فقط)، `ARIBA_MASTER_CONTEXT.md`.
> القاعدة: نظامنا هو الأساس (FastAPI + Next.js 16 + Expo + سكيمة Railway المرتّبة). ننقل ميزاتهم ومعادلاتهم وشاشاتهم، لا طريقتهم التقنية: لا اتصال من المتصفح بالقاعدة، ولا حسابات نهائية في المتصفح، ولا PWA.

### 0. الرموز
- الصفوف: 🟢 يبقى · 🟠/🔴 يُعدَّل ليطابق معادلتهم · 🟣 يُحذف · 🔵 يُضاف.
- الدوال: ✅ موجود عندنا · ✏️ موجود ويُعدَّل · 🆕 جديد · ✖ لا يُنقل (يُستبدل بطريقتنا).
- المسارات كلها تحت `/api/v1`.

### 1. القرارات المعتمدة (من البرومبت، لا تُعاد)
1. الصفان 113 و142 لا يُحذفان: يُعدَّلان ليطابقا شاشة تطبيقهم (`Home.jsx`: «رصيد نهاية العام» و«عن بعد المتبقي» = `remote_days_per_year − remoteDaysUsed`، الافتراضي 10) وبطاقة الشركة «حد العمل عن بعد».
2. الصف 66: يُحذف الإنهاء التلقائي عند انتهاء العقد. يُنقل سلوكهم: حفظ موظف منتهٍ وعقده المحدد غير منتهٍ ← يرجع نشطاً، وزر «إعادة تفعيل» في القائمة.
3. ما يحفظونه في المتصفح ينتقل للخادم (`ariba_app_settings`): القوائم الرئيسية، قوالب التقارير، عدّاد رقم صادر تعريف الراتب، مكان إصدار الهوية. توقيع الموظف يبقى على جهازه فقط (`expo-secure-store` / المتصفح)، ويصل للخادم المستند بعد دمج التوقيع.
4. رصيد الإجازة في التطبيق وفريق المدير يحسبه الخادم بنفس المحرك والطريقة المختارة (`leave_accrual_method`). لا لقطات.
5. كلمات مرور البريد مشفّرة (AES-GCM، المفتاح `MAIL_SECRET_KEY` في متغيرات البيئة).
6. الإيميل: SMTP وResend وMicrosoft Graph، مرفقات PDF.
7. الحسابات في الخادم، أو في `lib/calc` بالموقع للعرض الفوري. المرجع النهائي نتيجة الخادم، بنفس معادلتهم.
8. خصم الإجازة بدون راتب والراتب المقدم من المسيّر يدوي مثلهم.
9. لا تُنقل عيوبهم: سجل التعديلات من المتصفح، الجرس كل 3 ثوانٍ، `sw.js`، الإعدادات المثبتة في الكود.

### 2. البنية الجديدة في خادمنا
| الملف | المحتوى |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/routers/canonical.py` | يبقى (المسارات الحالية) مع التعديلات |

### 4. قائمة الحذف 🟣 (المهمة 4)
| الصف | البند | الإجراء |
|---|---|---|
| 66 | الإنهاء التلقائي عند انتهاء العقد | يُحذف — **ويُضاف** إعادة التفعيل عند الحفظ + زر «إعادة تفعيل» (قرار 2) |
| 70، 82 | م.87 (تصحيح D) | يُحذف من الصفحة والمخالصة والمسيّر |
| 72 | م.77 للعقد المحدد (تصحيح C) | يُحذف — يُعامل كغير المحدد |
| 100 | قاعدة ترحيل 2024 | تُحذف |
| 113 | رصيد نهاية السنة في التطبيق | **لا يُحذف** — يُعدَّل (قرار 1) |
| 114 | تجميد رصيد المنتهي | يُحذف |
| 137 | تصفير خروج الجلسة السابقة (K) | يُحذف |
| 142 | عدّاد العمل عن بعد | **لا يُحذف** — يُعدَّل (قرار 1) |
| 153 | تنبيه نظام العمل على الطلبات (E/F) | يُحذف |
| 188 | قفل الدخول بعد المحاولات الفاشلة | يُحذف |
| — | تصحيحات A، B، G، J، K، I (تُحذف ضمن صفوفها 🔴 بمطابقة معادلتهم) | 20/69/81، 74، 25–27، 12، 136، تنبيه الأعياد I |

### 5. النواقص الست (تُبنى من سلوك شاشاتهم)
1. `ariba_team_availability` → `GET /team/availability`: دمج الإجازات المتتالية، «إجازة قريبة» خلال 14 يوماً، «يعود للعمل» = أول يوم عمل بعد الإجازة.
2. `ariba_my_tasks` / `ariba_send_task` / `ariba_task_update` → `/tasks`: مهمة أو اجتماع، تحذير لو مدعو في إجازة، تم/قبول/اعتذار بسبب/إلغاء.
3. `ariba_hr_set_ramadan_flex` → `PUT /settings/attendance/ramadan`، ويقرؤها `GET /settings/attendance` (+ `is_ramadan_today`).
4. `ariba_get_brand` → `GET /public/brand` (ألوان الشركة + شعار البصمة).
5. `ariba-password-recovery` → `POST /auth/password-recovery` (اسم المستخدم أو رقم الإقامة، كلمة مؤقتة على الإيميل المسجّل).
6. `ariba-brand-colors` → `POST /settings/brand/extract` (ألوان من رابط موقع الشركة).

### 6. إضافات التقرير والكود (🔵 خارج ملف المقارنة)
- مساعد أريبا AI (فهم العامية، فتح صفحات، إحصائيات، حضور، إجازة، رسالة، إعادة كلمة مرور، نموذج/مخالصة/قسيمة، تأكيد قبل التنفيذ) → `services/port_ai.py` (نقل `aiParse.js` إلى Python) + `components/hr/ai-assistant.tsx`.
- البصمة / Face ID: التطبيق `expo-local-authentication` + «تذكرني» و«نسيان هذا الجهاز»؛ الموقع WebAuthn (`ariba_webauthn_credentials`).
- حذف شهر أقدم من 30 يوماً من سجل التعديلات بطلب للمالية (موافقة/رفض).
- استيراد الموظفين من Excel/CSV مع مطابقة الأعمدة، معاينة، قالب، وتحديث الموجودين (V139).
- عربي/إنجليزي مع الاتجاه، الوضع الليلي، ألوان أريبا متغيرات (موجود جزئياً، يُستكمل).
- جرس إشعارات بعدّاد: الموقع يحدّث كل 20 ثانية؛ التطبيق Push + تحديث عند الفتح.
- البديل عند تعذّر الإرسال: تحميل PDF + فتح Outlook (سطح المكتب `mailto:` أو الويب)، إعداد لكل جهاز.
- الإعدادات في 9 أقسام مرقّمة مع بحث، 24 كارت.
- 10 مستندات عربي/إنجليزي (`<!--ARIBA_EN-->`)، العرض الوظيفي، رقم صادر `AR-YYYYMMDD-n` + هجري، إرسال جماعي، PDF A4 صفحة واحدة (تصغير حتى 1.35).
- تسجيل المرشحين تلقائياً (`candidate_auto`) كمهمة مجدولة.
- مسار المسيّر: تجهيز HR ← اعتماد المالية ← فتح بسبب ≥ 5 أحرف، حفظ تلقائي، مزامنة تعديلات الآخرين.
- الأصول والعهد: قسط ثابت، أعمار افتراضية، غير رأسمالي، جرد سنوي، تبويب العهدة في ملف الموظف.
- البدل كنسبة (`allowModes`)، التابعون مع مرفقاتهم، «استرجاع» لكل حقل.
- منشئ التقارير المخصص + قوالب محفوظة في الخادم + «تصدير الصفحة» (Excel/PDF/Word/إيميل).
- محرّر أرصدة السنوات (yearEnd/current/carryNext/eos يدوي) + سجل آخر 10 حفظات + «تراجع عن آخر حفظ».

### 7. المراحل (كل مرحلة commit وتُختبر وحدها)
| المرحلة | المحتوى | الاختبار |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | هذه الخطة | — |
| P2 | `tools/react-parity` (المرجع + المولد + المقارنة TS/Python) | تُظهر نفس فروق ملف المقارنة |
| P3a | PAYX + صفوف المسيّر (N، الاستقالة، noEos، G، الاستشاري الخارجي، الإضافي القديم، مصر) | react-parity صفر في PAYX |
| P3b | التأمينات (الجدول التلقائي) + بيانات الموظف + نهاية الخدمة + المخالصة | react-parity صفر |
| P3c | محرك الإجازات (الطرق الثلاث، الترحيل، المستورد، INTERRUPT، الفائض) | react-parity صفر + pytest |
| P3d | الحضور (الجدول ورمضان، الغائبين)، لوحة التحكم والتنبيهات، التقارير، 113/142 | pytest |
| P4 | حذف 🟣 + اختبار لكل بند | pytest + legacy-parity محدّث |
| P5 | ترحيل السكيما `docs/db-migrations/` + تجربته على نسخة من `ariba_after2` | سكربت التحقق |
| P6a–f | الخادم: سير الطلبات، المرشحون، المستهدفات، المستندات والتوقيع، البريد والمجدولة، المهام، الأصول، السجل، الإعدادات، المساعد | pytest لكل مسار |
| P7a–h | الموقع: المالية، الموظفون والمرشحون، الإجازات والفريق، المستهدفات، التقارير، الإعدادات، السجل، المساعد | تصفح محلي + لقطات |
| P8 | التطبيق: كل الشاشات | محاكي iOS + لقطات |
| P9 | نموذج التقديم العام `/apply` | pytest + تصفح |
| P10 | التحقق الكامل `docs/19_PORT_VERIFICATION.md` | كل الفحوصات |
